This repository is my interpretation of the automobile dataset available in the UCI repository. 

To make sure that the notebook works on your machine, please make sure `pip` is installed, and you run the following command: 

`pip -r requirements.txt`

Ideally this would run in a virtual environment to avoid surprises with package mismatch. 

To visualise the notebook in a browser run the following commands in your terminal: 
```
cd regression_challenge
jupyter notebook
```

and proceed to select the only jupyter notebook in the folder.
